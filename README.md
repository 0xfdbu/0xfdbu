# Hey, Iâ€™m Syv ðŸ§ 

Smart contract engineer building tooling, protocols, and launch systems across EVM chains and TON.  
Focused on gas-efficient, modular architecture with real-world deployment in mind.

Developer since 2017 with experience across the full stack â€” from low-level smart contracts to high-performance web apps.  
I build clean, **pixel-perfect UIs from Figma**, and scalable backends using modern full-stack tools.
